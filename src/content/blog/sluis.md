[Sluis](https://sluis.nilsbeerten.nl) is a new desktop-optimised frontend for Piped.
For context, Piped is a proxy that allows people to watch videos on YouTube,
without comprising their privacy. You can read more about how Piped
works on their GitHub: [TeamPiped/Piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped).

On android various apps like [LibreTube](https://github.com/libre-tube/LibreTube)
exist, which make using Piped much easier and smoother.
On the web the only "good" option is the Piped
frontend, like on [piped.video](https://piped.video). This frontend works
fine, but I wanted to make an alternative that's easier to use while also
being desktop-optimised and keeping most of the features the
[piped.video](https://piped.video) frontend has.

[Sluis](https://sluis.nilsbeerten.nl) is the result of that. So far it offers most of the features that
[piped.video](https://piped.video) offers, with the exception of playlists.
It's built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev),
[shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/),
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and
of course the privacy-focused Piped backend for interacting with YouTube.
