Hello, world! This is the third, maybe even fourth or fifth iteration
of my website. A new website with a fresh, minimal and modern design.
This time, I made the website with Astro, a Javascript-framework for static and dynamic websites.

For this iteration I’ve chosen a classic dark theme website, but with a slight
hint of yellow/amber throughout, for example in the text, borders and background.
This theme is inspired by [Fontshare](https://fontshare.com/)'s coloured themes,
which also use similar hints of colours. The general design of the site is
inspired by [nexxel](https://nexxel.dev/)'s website.

In the future, I hope to post a few blog posts once in a while on here, about
whatever I’m working on at that time.
